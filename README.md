💡 Project Title: Calculating Family Expenses Using ServiceNow
This is a ServiceNow-based solution developed during our internship to help families manage and monitor household expenses in a structured, automated, and user-friendly manner. The system enables users to log daily expenses, connect them to family-level budgets, and receive alerts when financial limits are exceeded.

🔧 Key Features
Custom tables for Family Expenses and Daily Expenses
Auto-numbering for each record (e.g., MFE001, DFE001)
Related lists to link daily expenses with family-level data
Business rules for budget limit monitoring and alerts
Custom forms for simplified expense entry
Reports for categorized spending insights
