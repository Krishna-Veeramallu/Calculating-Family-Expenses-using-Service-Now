# 📊 Calculating Family Expenses Using ServiceNow

This is a ServiceNow-based solution developed during our internship to help families manage and monitor household expenses in a structured, automated, and user-friendly manner. The system enables users to log daily expenses, connect them to family-level budgets, and receive alerts when financial limits are exceeded.
